# Gamma_Oscillations_PCx

This repository contains all python codes to reproduce Figures 1-7 of Gonzalez, et al, 2023. 
"Mechanisms and functions of respiration-driven gamma oscillations in the primary olfactory cortex"

The datasets should be downloaded from: (https://crcns.org/data-sets/pcx/pcx-1). The downsampled LFPs are available at: (https.direction.com)

All codes start from the raw data, run all analysis, and plot the figures from the paper.

To start, the extension to all files in the processed folders should be changed to .mat. Specifically, xxx_bank1.efd files should be renamed to xxx_bank_efd.mat, the same with bank2, while the xxx.resp files to xxx_resp.mat
